# Vortex
  `My name is Martin Nnajiofor-Ifeakandu, I am a Front-end Web Developer, CMS
Expert and UI/UX Designer. My role in this project, was to oversee every aspect
of the development. From brainstorming the idea, to developing it and
deploying it online. As a one-man team, I coded and designed this social
media app. 
  `Vortex is a social media application, where users can chat with other random users. 
The main concept of this project, is for users to be able to chat with others
users online anonymously. It will be like a vortex, with a maximum of 10 people
in a group chat, all random users. So I thought to myself, is there any app
like this that exists already?. The answer was no, but there were similar
ideas. Omegle for example, lets users chat with strangers, although it is two
users maximum on video call and text. The second application that came to mind
was Snapchat. It lets users send messages, whether audio, text, image or
video. And it is disappears after a certain period. I decided the combine both
concepts and integrate them into my app.
	`I used HTML and CSS on the front-end and NodeJs, ExpressJs and Socket.io on the server side. I decided to use
these technologies, because I am familiar with them. The most difficult technical challenge I faced while building my app was implementing the chat room functionality. The idea behind the chatrooms
is that it will include messaging functionalities. Users will be able to send
only text and audio messages in the chat. And it will have a maximum of 10 users
per group chat. The group chats and users will be random. So a user cannot join a
specific group chat when they enter the vortex. I was able to set up the chatroom
to enable users send and receive text messages. Some of the other functionalities
are yet to be added.
